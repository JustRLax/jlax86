  project_description: "<p>Learn Drifting is a brand that strives to preserve the
    origins of stylish drifting in Japan by providing a hub for education and a video
    series that encourages using driving simulators to improve drift and driving techniques.
    In this project I've been able to incorporate my love for driving, designing,
    coding, music and video into a single project. Take a look at the driving video
    preview to see a sneak peek of the video series.</p>"
